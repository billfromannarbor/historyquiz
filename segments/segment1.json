    "introduction": "You blink, and the swirling void of the time rift vanishes. The air is thick with humidity, the scent of ink and parchment filling your nose. A commotion surrounds you. Men in powdered wigs and long coats are gathered in a candlelit hall, their voices rising in heated debate. You realize where you are. Independence Hall. Otherkitten, perched smugly on a wooden desk, swats at a quill pen. You glance aroundâ€”no one seems to notice you or the cat. That's when you see it: The Declaration of Independence is missing. A scrap of parchment fluttered at your feet. Scribbled hastily in ink: 'The fate of a nation is at stake. Find the missing words before it's too late.'",
