    "introduction": "The time rift spits you out onto the wooden deck of a ship, the salty sea air whipping at your face. Around you, sailors are bustling about, their eyes filled with anticipation—and some with doubt. A sailor grips a tattered piece of parchment, his hands shaking. 'The navigation map… it's missing!' Otherkitten perches on a wooden barrel, watching the waves. A scrap of paper fluttered near its paws, inscribed with a cryptic message: 'Without the path, the voyage is lost. Find the missing truth before time is tossed.' You realize that Columbus's ability to navigate is in jeopardy. If you don't restore the correct information, history could be thrown off course.",
