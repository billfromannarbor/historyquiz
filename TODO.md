1. Need it to be more compact with everything on the same page without scrolling.  

So maybe we could resize the images so that when the question is asked, the image takes up less room.

For Multiple Choice answers - We should change the color of the button to show that it is selected.
 
 For all questions:
 We should not show the answer until the submit button is selected
 When we show the answer it should be in green if it's correct or in red if it's incorrect
 When we should the answer we should show the points they earned and their new score.
